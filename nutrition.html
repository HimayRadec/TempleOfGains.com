                <p class="information">
                    Cutting is when you are losing weight in an attempt to cut body fat.
                    When cutting it is recommended to eat a minimum of 1.5g-2g of protein per pound of body weight.
                    In order to lose weight you must be a in a caloric deficit. A recommended deficit is around
                    200-500
                    calories per day.
                    It is not recommended that you lose more than 2 lbs per week in order to hold on to as much
                    muscle
                    mass
                    as possible.
                    When cutting you will tend to lose some muscle mass, but will hopefully be a very negligible
                    amount
                    as
                    long as your nutrition is on point
                    and your training.

                <h1 class="header">Water</h1>
                <p class="information">
                    Some of the benefits water provides is it flushes out toxins and other metabolic wastes from the
                    body.
                    When following a high protein diet this is extremely imporant. You should aim to consume
                    1/2 to 1 fl oz of water per pound of body weight.

                <h1 class="header">Nutrition For Bulking</h1>
                <p class="information">
                    Bulking is when you are gaining weight in an attempt to put on muscle.
                    When bulking it is recommended to eat a minimum of 1g-2g of protein per pound of body weight.
                    In order to gain weight you must be in a caloric surplus. A recommend surplus is around 300-500
                    calories
                    per day.
                    It is not recommend that you gain more than 4 lbs of weight per weak if your goal is minimize
                    fat
                    gain
                    while maximizing muscle growth.
                    The more weight you gain in a shorter period the more likely you are to put on fat. When cutting
                    you
                    will put on fat regardless.
                    The amount of fat gained depends on the surplus of your calories.
